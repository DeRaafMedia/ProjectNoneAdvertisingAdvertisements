These graphics are made as a side project for me. 

I decided to convert my computer envoriment fulltime to Linux. Needed something to familiarise me with the software package Inkscape.

Also I'm a long time vaper. It's forbidden to do advertisment for vaping products, but brick and mortar store still have a need to dress up their shop. So I thought of doing a little series of advertisment stuff without it being actual advertisment for products. 

Just a fun little projects. Maybe I do some more in the future.
